# üìã Project 1

## Create a number guessing game with a simple interface

Guess a number between 1 and 100 in as few attempts as possible.

_This will require you to populate the HTML with the necessary elements for the front-end user experience and then implement the JavaScript logic._

## ‚ö° Quickstart

### MacOS / WSL / Linux / ChromeOS

Clone the repository (replacing `USERNAME`):

```bash
git clone https://github.iu.edu/i365sp2025/USERNAME-project-1.git
cd USERNAME-project-1
```

## üì± Interface && Game Play

### üìù Requirements

- `Optional`: Use `Bootstrap` to help you with the layout. For example, it can be used to [make a button](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/buttons/).
- `H1/H2/P/etc...`: Interface should include a `title for the game` and `directions for what to do / expect`
  (We DO NOT expect yours to look like ours, in fact ours is the lowest bar for what the interface should look like / include. )
- `GUESS BUTTON`: Use the provided form `INPUT` element paired with a button to get a number from the user; this is the user‚Äôs **guess**
  (For the sake of the exercise, use text input and not number input -- we want you to practice your new skills.)

```html
<input type="text" id="inputGuess" name="inputGuess" placeholder="Make a guess"/>
<!-- To get the number entered by the user, you want the element‚Äôs **value** 
If Element.textContent gets the content of a P tag, then Element.value gets the content of an INPUT tag -->
```

- `REPLAY BUTTON`: Allow the game to be played again
- `DIV`: Create a space for messages to the user updating their progress (too high / too low / guessed it);
- `Tip`: [Number.isInteger()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/isInteger)
- If the `number` is not valid (either not a number or out of range), display an appropriate error message
- Display the `number` of that guesses have been made so far, and keep this value updated in the interface
- When the `number` is correctly guessed, `INPUT` and `GUESS` button are disabled, and the only option is to `REPLAY`;
- `Tip`: you want to _disable_ the button and the input with an attribute (possible methods to modify HTML attributes are listed in Chapter 5). Anything given an attribute of `‚Äúdisabled‚Äù` can then be styled in the CSS, for example:

```
*:disabled {
    background-color: lightgray;
    color: #333333;
    opacity: 0.8;
    pointer-events: none;
}
```

Or, because we are using Bootstrap, [_you could look up how to do this in their documentation._](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/#disabled-state)

## üìú Expectations

- Create your project `individually`. It is not a group assignment.
- Design and layout should meet expectations similar to in `i360 - CARP design principles, good hierarchy, well structured HTML and CSS`
- Use `functions, good naming and syntax conventions, and comments` as needed - remember the goal is `self-commenting code`
- If you look up code / techniques we have not introduced in class, it would be wise to `explain in a comment what you are doing`, why, and `link` to where you learned it
- Create Project 1 by making a local `clone` of your IU GitHub repository
- Submit your work by `commiting regularly`, then syncing with your IU Github repository by the deadline

## üìö Recommended Steps

1.  First make the number guessing game purely in the JavaScript (and the console) with no HTML elements at all. Use `prompt()` to take user inputs, and `console.log()` to output feedback. Make sure all the game logic works, including checking the validity of the user input and tracking the number of guesses.
2.  Next, add in the `minimal` number of HTML elements for an interactive game (e.g. input text fields, buttons).
    `Integrate` the HTML interface with your coded JavaScript game.
3.  Finally, use `CSS` to create a usable interface, adding in additional elements and resources as needed.
4.  Remember, `manually test often`, test along the way, and test after you‚Äôre done! Edge cases, for example, might be non-numbers, non-integers and numbers that are not in range.
