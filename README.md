#  𐙚 ‧₊˚ JavaScript Projects Repository ˚₊‧ 𐙚 

Welcome to my JavaScript Projects GitHub repo! ૮ ˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶ ა

This is where I’ve collected all the projects I made while taking **INFO-I365: JavaScript** at Indiana University. Throughout the course, I learned to create interactive websites using JavaScript, Bootstrap, and a variety of other cool (and sometimes complex!) programming tools.

Expect to see:
- 🦢 Fun and functional web apps
- 🪐༘ Code experiments and challenges
- 🍮 Bootstrap-powered designs

Thanks for visiting, feel free to explore!₊✩‧₊˚౨ৎ˚₊✩‧₊
