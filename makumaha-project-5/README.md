## Directions

### Update the Interface: 
- provide form elements to allow a user to select additional styles such as "white" (or "gray"), "erase", "rainbow", "wild" and "random" using form elements -- it should be clear what style is currently chosen
- provide a form element to allow user to adjust line width
- provide a form element to allow user to choose a custom color
- (optional) adjust interface styling

### Expand the Functionality:
- user can now also draw with the mouse
- **white** style draws in white (or optionally you can have the background white and make this a "gray" pen style)
- **erase** style draws in the same color as the canvas background
- **rainbow** style cycles through the hue as user draws
- **wild** style randomly selects a hue each time the mouse is moved
- **random** styles randomly selects a new hue each time the button is clicked or the mouse is clicked to start drawing
- allow user to adjust line width
- allow user to draw with a custom color
